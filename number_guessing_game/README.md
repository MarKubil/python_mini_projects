# Python Mini Projects ðŸ§ª

A collection of small Python projects built for practice, experimentation, and skill sharpening. Each folder contains a self-contained script with its own README and purpose.

## Projects Included

- `blackjack/` â€“ Console-based Blackjack game with basic logic and user interaction  
- *(More coming soon...)*

## Why This Repo Exists

This repo tracks my growth as a developer. These aren't polished apps â€” they're tactical exercises in logic, structure, and problem-solving. I use them to test ideas, refactor code, and build muscle memory before tackling larger freelance or portfolio projects.

## How to Run

Each project is standalone. Just navigate into a folder and run:

```bash
python project_name.py
```
