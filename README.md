# Python Mini Projects ðŸ§ª

A collection of small Python projects built for practice, experimentation, and skill sharpening. Each folder contains a self-contained script with its own README and purpose.

## Projects Included

- `blackjack/` â€“ Console-based Blackjack game with basic logic and user interaction  
- `number_guessing_game/` â€“ Simple number guessing game with ASCII banner and input validation  
- `higher_lower_game/` â€“ Number comparison game where users guess if the next value is higher or lower  
- `coffee_machine/` â€“ Simulates a coffee vending machine with coin logic, resource tracking, and modular design  
- *(More coming soon...)*  


## Why This Repo Exists

This repo tracks my growth as a developer. These aren't polished apps â€” they're tactical exercises in logic, structure, and problem-solving. I use them to test ideas, refactor code, and build muscle memory before tackling larger freelance or portfolio projects.

## How to Run

Each project is standalone. Just navigate into a folder and run:

```bash
python project_name.py
```
